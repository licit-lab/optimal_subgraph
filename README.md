# optimal_subgraph
Code from an article send to Communications in Transportation Research

This code is written in Java and R, and OPL

The Java code is used to generate the optimal subgraph from data (not provided)

The Scripts in R are used in order to re-generate the results in the article

The OPL files (mod and dat) are used to compute the optimal subgraph with CPLEX (that has to be installed)

The .dat files have to be created with the java program, from the data (not provided) OR please contact me in order to get them (files too big to be put here)
